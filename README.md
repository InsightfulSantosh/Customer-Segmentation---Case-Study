## Introduction

Customer segmentation is a crucial aspect of business strategy, allowing companies to better understand and serve their customers. This case study focuses on segmenting customers based on their purchasing behavior and demographic information to derive actionable insights.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this case study includes various features related to customer demographics and purchasing behavior. The key columns in the dataset are:
- `CustomerID`: Unique identifier for each customer
- `Age`: Age of the customer
- `Gender`: Gender of the customer
- `Income`: Annual income of the customer
- `Spending Score`: Score assigned based on customer spending behavior
- `Recency`: Number of days since the last purchase
- `MntWines`: Amount spent on wines
- `MntFruits`: Amount spent on fruits
- `MntMeatProducts`: Amount spent on meat products
- `MntFishProducts`: Amount spent on fish products
- `MntSweetProducts`: Amount spent on sweet products
- `MntGoldProds`: Amount spent on gold products

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA involves examining the dataset to understand its structure, detect patterns, and identify anomalies. The following steps are performed during EDA:
- Descriptive statistics
- Missing value analysis
- Outlier detection
- Visualization of feature distributions
- Correlation analysis

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing is essential to prepare the dataset for segmentation. The steps include:
- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical variables
- Scaling numerical features
- Feature selection

## Segmentation Techniques

### K-Means Clustering

K-Means is a popular clustering algorithm that partitions the data into K distinct clusters. The steps include:
- Choosing the number of clusters (K)
- Initializing cluster centroids
- Assigning points to the nearest centroid
- Updating centroids until convergence

### Hierarchical Clustering

Hierarchical clustering builds a tree of clusters. The steps include:
- Calculating the distance matrix
- Merging the closest clusters iteratively
- Visualizing the dendrogram to choose the number of clusters

### DBSCAN

Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) groups points based on density. The steps include:
- Choosing parameters: epsilon (Îµ) and minimum points (minPts)
- Classifying points as core, border, or noise
- Forming clusters based on core points

## Model Evaluation

Evaluating the quality of clusters is crucial. The metrics used include:

### Silhouette Score
Measures how similar an object is to its own cluster compared to other clusters.

### Davies-Bouldin Index
Measures the average similarity ratio of each cluster with its most similar cluster.

### Elbow Method
Helps to determine the optimal number of clusters by plotting the sum of squared distances.

## Insights and Visualization

Visualizations help to interpret the results and derive insights. The visualizations include:
- Cluster plots
- Heatmaps
- Parallel coordinate plots
- Customer profiles

## Conclusions

This section summarizes the findings of the case study, highlighting the key customer segments identified and their characteristics. It also discusses the implications for business strategy and marketing.

## Future Work

Possible extensions of this case study include:
- Incorporating more features for better segmentation
- Using advanced clustering techniques like Gaussian Mixture Models
- Applying segmentation to different domains
